# Places where flex is currently better  
  
Flexbox and Grid can live together. This isn’t a “one or the other” deal. There are still times where you will want to use Flexbox instead of Grid. Masonry is a good example. Grids where the number of items is indeterminate are another. And what happens if you want those final items to stretch and fill the available space in ways that overlap grid columns? Grid can’t do that.  
  
Don’t throw out older tools. They can still be useful.
