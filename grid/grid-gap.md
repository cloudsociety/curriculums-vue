# Grid-Gap

Adding space between grid columns and rows is a single command: `grid-gap`. A single measurement can give you consistent gaps in both directions. 

```css
grid-gap: 2rem;
```

`grid-gap` can take two different measurements: row-gap and column-gap (respectively… you’ll see this order a lot. Try to remember that it’s “run before rise”). This is the better option for when you’re trying to match row gaps to vertical rhythm.
