# Grid-Gap Gotcha  
  
Anything other than a centered gap will be off if column count isnâ€™t equal. This is because the number of **gaps** have to be equal â€” Grid subtracts the gaps and distributes the remainder.   
  
The way to avoid these misalignments is to always have the same number of gaps and use `grid-template-auto` to _span_ columns.

  1fr    1fr    1fr

|      |      |      |  
+------+------+------+  
  
  2fr          1fr
