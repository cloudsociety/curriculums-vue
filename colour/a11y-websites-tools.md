# Colour Accessibility Websites and Tools

There are tons of other free and paid tools out there for checking accessibility. Here are a few I've used.

* [Colorable](http://jxnblk.com/colorable/demos/text/): A great way to visualize colour contrast issues for free.
* [Eightshapes](https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/?background-colors=&foreground-colors=%23FFFFFF%2C%20White%0D%0A%23F2F2F2%0D%0A%23DDDDDD%0D%0A%23CCCCCC%0D%0A%23888888%0D%0A%23404040%2C%20Charcoal%0D%0A%23000000%2C%20Black%0D%0A%232F78C5%2C%20Effective%20on%20Extremes%0D%0A%230F60B6%2C%20Effective%20on%20Lights%0D%0A%23398EEA%2C%20Ineffective%0D%0A&es-color-form__tile-size=compact): A quick way to generate a table of contrast ratios. Makes it easy to compare all your colours at once.
* [Wai-aria tool](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/): The original contrast checker. Still works.
* [Funky](https://www.funkify.org/): A _freemium_ Chrome extension for testing a bunch of common accessibility issues. The free version is pretty awesome.
* [Xscope](https://xscopeapp.com/): A paid app for making sure your projects is lining up. Also has some good tools for checking vision accessibility issues.
* [Sketch WCAG plugin](https://github.com/bryanberger/sketch-wcag): An extension for Sketch. Select a bunch of colours, trigger the plugin, and get a nicely formatted webpage showing how colours rate against each other.
