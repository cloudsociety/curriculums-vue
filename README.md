# Introduction

This is a series of curriculums I'm in the process of creating. When finished it will be screencasts accompanied by this text, codepen demos, and any other resources I can think of along the way.

It is a bit of a living document and the lessons are designed to be reordered and added to as my experience in Educational Design grows.
